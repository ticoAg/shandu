## üîç What is Shandu?

Shandu is an intelligent, LLM-powered research system that automates the comprehensive research process - from initial query clarification to in-depth content analysis and report generation. Built on LangGraph's state-based workflow, it recursively explores topics with sophisticated algorithms for source evaluation, content extraction, and knowledge synthesis.

### Key Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Generate literature reviews, background information, and complex topic analyses
- **Market Intelligence**: Analyze industry trends, competitor strategies, and market opportunities
- **Content Creation**: Produce well-researched articles, blog posts, and reports with proper citations
- **Technology Exploration**: Track emerging technologies, innovations, and technical developments
- **Policy Analysis**: Research regulations, compliance requirements, and policy implications
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare products, services, and company strategies across industries

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install shandu

# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/jolovicdev/shandu.git
cd shandu
pip install -e .
```

## üèÅ Quick Start

```bash
# Configure API settings (supports various LLM providers)
shandu configure

# Run comprehensive research
shandu research "Your research query" --depth 2 --breadth 4 --output report.md

# Quick AI-powered search with web scraping (You dont need Perplexity!)
shandu aisearch "Who is the current sitting president of United States?" --detailed

# Basic multi-engine search
shandu search "Your search query"
```

## üìö Detailed Usage

### Research Command

```bash
shandu research "Your research query" \
    --depth 3 \                # How deep to explore (1-5, default: 2)
    --breadth 5 \              # How many parallel queries (2-10, default: 4)
    --output report.md \       # Save to file instead of terminal
    --verbose                  # Show detailed progress
```

### Example Reports

You can find example reports in the examples directory:

1. **The Intersection of Quantum Computing, Synthetic Biology, and Climate Modeling**
   ```bash
   shandu research "The Intersection of Quantum Computing, Synthetic Biology, and Climate Modeling" --depth 3 --breadth 3 --output examples/o3-mini-high.md
   ```

### AI Search Command with Scraping

```bash
shandu aisearch "Your search query" \
    --engines "google,duckduckgo" \  # Comma-separated list of search engines
    --max-results 15 \               # Maximum number of results to return
    --output results.md \            # Save to file instead of terminal
    --detailed                       # Generate a detailed analysis
```

## üíª Python API

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

# Initialize the research graph
researcher = ResearchGraph(
    llm=llm,
    temperature=0.5
)

# Perform deep research
results = researcher.research_sync(
    query="Your research query",
    depth=3,       # How deep to go with recursive research
    breadth=4,     # How many parallel queries to explore
    detail_level="high"
)

# Print or save results
print(results.to_markdown())
